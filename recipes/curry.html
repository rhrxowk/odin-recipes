    <li>2 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>thumb-sized piece of ginger</li>
    <li>6 chicken thighs</li>
    <li>3 tbsp medium spice paste</li>
    <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
    <li>100g Greek yogurt</li>
    <li>1 small bunch of coriander</li>
    <li>50g ground almonds</li>
    <li>naan breads</li>
</ul>

    <li>Heat the oil in a flameproof casserole dish or large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and a generous pinch of salt and fry for 8-10 mins, or until the onion has turned golden brown and sticky. Add the garlic and ginger, cooking for a further minute.</li>
    <li>Chop the chicken into chunky 3cm pieces, add to the pan and fry for 5 mins before stirring through the spice paste and tomatoes, along with 250ml water. Bring to the boil, lower to a simmer and cook on a gentle heat uncovered for 25-30 mins or until rich and slightly reduced. Stir though the yogurt, coriander and ground almonds, season and serve with warm naan or fluffy basmati rice.</li>
